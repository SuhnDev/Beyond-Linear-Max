# Beyond Linear Max
### Cost-Aware Maximum Finding

This repository explores a threshold-based approach to maximum finding.  
While the theoretical lower bound for maximum search remains **Θ(n)**,  
we investigate whether **cost-aware filtering** can reduce *practical runtime*  
in scenarios where post-processing of candidate elements is expensive.

---

## 🔍 Idea
- Standard maximum finding requires scanning all elements → Θ(n).
- Our approach introduces a **threshold filter**:
  1. Estimate an upper bound for the maximum.
  2. Discard elements below a threshold (e.g., 50% of the bound).
  3. Only compare the reduced candidate set.

- This does **not** improve worst-case complexity,  
  but can reduce the number of expensive operations in practical settings.

---

## 📊 Applications
- Information retrieval (reduce re-ranking candidates)
- Machine learning (filtering before heavy model inference)
- Database queries (avoiding expensive lookups on low-value rows)
- Financial/streaming systems (focus on top signals only)

---

## ⚙️ Example Code
The repository includes a simple Python prototype:

```bash
python cost_aware_maximum_finding.py

Example output:
Linear scan: 0.012 sec
Threshold scan: 0.007 sec


*(Times depend on data distribution and threshold choice.)*

## 🛠️ Tech
- Python 3
- Basic random dataset simulation
- Matplotlib (optional, for plotting results)

---

## 📌 Notes
- This is a **prototype** and not an optimized production algorithm.
- The goal is to demonstrate that **cost-aware strategies** can  
  sometimes outperform naive linear scans in practice.
